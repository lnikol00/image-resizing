# image-resizing
Image resizing using verilog. It is done by copying 1 pixel of input image into 4 pixels of output image .Input is taken as hex file and output is bmp image.

NOTE: You should not synthesize this code because it is not designed for running on FPGA, but rather for functional verification purposes.  If you really want to synthesize this code (read and process) and load the image into FPGA for processing directly on FPGA, replace all the temp. variables (red, blue, green, temp_memory, memory) by block RAMs and generate addresses to read the image data (remove the always @(start) and all the "for loops" - these are for simulation purposes). There are two ways: 1. write a RAM code and initialize the image data into the memory using $readmemh; 2. generate a block memory using either Xilinx Core Generator or Altera MegaFunction and load the image data into the initial values of memory (.coe file for Xilinx Core Gen. and .mif for Altera MegaFunction), then read the image data from memory and process it (FSM Design).
